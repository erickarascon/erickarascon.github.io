**Research**
 
My research focuses on how parents influence child development and adolescent behaviour (schooling, learning and sexual outcomes), as well as how interventions could use behavioural insights to be more effective on the promotion of healthy habits and dissemination of information to facilitate labour market and school-related choices.  
 
My most recent research project in the field is an extension of my doctoral work on subjective expectations and aspirations to increase schooling enrolment and learning outcomes in rural communities in Nigeria.
 
I am also working with political scientists to design interventions to promote democratic behaviour, as well as with government agencies and international organisations to promote mobile learning and mobile banking.   
 
My experience on design and evaluation of social interventions has been primarily focused on Africa and Middle East.

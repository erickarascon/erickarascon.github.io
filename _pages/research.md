My research focuses on how parents influence child development and adolescent behaviour (schooling, learning and sexual outcomes), as well as how interventions could use behavioural insights to be more effective on the promotion of healthy habits and dissemination of information to facilitate labour market and school-related choices.  
 
My most recent research projects in the field focus on how to increase schooling enrolment and learning outcomes as well as to decrease early parenthood in rural communities in developing countries.
 
I am also working with political scientists to design interventions to promote democratic behaviour, as well as with government agencies and international organisations to promote mobile learning and mobile banking.   
 
My experience on design, implementation, and evaluation of social interventions in the field and on online platforms has been primarily in Africa and Middle East.
